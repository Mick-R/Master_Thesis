B,Luiten,Production,"Luiten Food – Thomas Foods Europa is een warm familiebedrijf uit Stompwijk met een loyaal, ervaren en vooral betrokken team. Tot een aantal jaar geleden noemden wij ons importeur van vlees, wild en gevogelte. Dat dekt de lading echter al een tijdje niet meer: niet alleen hebben wij ons assortiment flink uitgebreid, maar ook is de import van onze producten inmiddels slechts het begin van een mooie schakel aan diensten die wij onze klanten bieden. Wij zijn uitgegroeid tot een essentiële partner voor onze supermarkt- en groothandelsklanten, omdat we producten ontwikkelen, portioneren, marineren, verpakken, etiketteren en volledig naar wens aanleveren. Alles gebeurt op basis van de specifieke klantwens, in samenwerking met onze partners. Ons assortiment wordt bepaald vanuit een duidelijke marktbehoefte: de proteïnen die wij importeren zijn in Europa nog niet verkrijgbaar, onvoldoende verkrijgbaar of in mindere kwaliteit verkrijgbaar.

Het importeren van kwaliteitsproducten blijft van primair belang voor ons. Zonder product kunnen wij namelijk het verschil niet maken voor onze klanten. Daarom hebben wij in 2018 besloten de samenwerking met de Australische rund- en lamsvleesproducent Thomas Foods International (TFI) te intensiveren, waarbij TFI een belang heeft genomen in Luiten Food – Thomas Foods Europa.  Als Thomas Foods Europa genieten wij nu al vijf jaar van productzekerheid en exclusiviteit voor deze twee productgroepen. Ons doel is meedoen op het hoogste niveau. Wij streven naar duurzame samenwerkingen met klanten en leveranciers: kwaliteit en betrouwbaarheid zullen op de lange termijn altijd zegevieren. Wie ons al langer kent, weet dat wij doen wat we beloven. Afspraak is afspraak. Wij realiseren bedrijfsgroei, omdat krimp simpelweg geen optie is. Alleen door continu te verbeteren, kunnen wij onze klanten de service bieden die zij van ons gewend zijn. Investeringen in het bedrijf, de machines, onze mensen en natuurlijk ons lang gekoesterde netwerk zullen wij nooit uit de weg gaan; die vormen namelijk de basis voor onze toegevoegde waarde.",Cutting room employee,Zoetermeer,full-time,36 hour,high-school,entry level,14.5 per hour,practical workforce,- Reliability - Physical stamina - Safety awareness,- Physically demanding work - Fast-paced environment - Strict safety protocols,"You must be able to lift heavy crates, stand for extended periods, and have no other physical limitations.

[COMPANY INFORMATION]
Company name: Luiten
Industry sector: Production
Company description: Luiten Food – Thomas Foods Europa is een warm familiebedrijf uit Stompwijk met een loyaal, ervaren en vooral betrokken team. Tot een aantal jaar geleden noemden wij ons importeur van vlees, wild en gevogelte. Dat dekt de lading echter al een tijdje niet meer: niet alleen hebben wij ons assortiment flink uitgebreid, maar ook is de import van onze producten inmiddels slechts het begin van een mooie schakel aan diensten die wij onze klanten bieden. Wij zijn uitgegroeid tot een essentiële partner voor onze supermarkt- en groothandelsklanten, omdat we producten ontwikkelen, portioneren, marineren, verpakken, etiketteren en volledig naar wens aanleveren. Alles gebeurt op basis van de specifieke klantwens, in samenwerking met onze partners. Ons assortiment wordt bepaald vanuit een duidelijke marktbehoefte: de proteïnen die wij importeren zijn in Europa nog niet verkrijgbaar, onvoldoende verkrijgbaar of in mindere kwaliteit verkrijgbaar.

Het importeren van kwaliteitsproducten blijft van primair belang voor ons. Zonder product kunnen wij namelijk het verschil niet maken voor onze klanten. Daarom hebben wij in 2018 besloten de samenwerking met de Australische rund- en lamsvleesproducent Thomas Foods International (TFI) te intensiveren, waarbij TFI een belang heeft genomen in Luiten Food – Thomas Foods Europa.  Als Thomas Foods Europa genieten wij nu al vijf jaar van productzekerheid en exclusiviteit voor deze twee productgroepen. Ons doel is meedoen op het hoogste niveau. Wij streven naar duurzame samenwerkingen met klanten en leveranciers: kwaliteit en betrouwbaarheid zullen op de lange termijn altijd zegevieren. Wie ons al langer kent, weet dat wij doen wat we beloven. Afspraak is afspraak. Wij realiseren bedrijfsgroei, omdat krimp simpelweg geen optie is. Alleen door continu te verbeteren, kunnen wij onze klanten de service bieden die zij van ons gewend zijn. Investeringen in het bedrijf, de machines, onze mensen en natuurlijk ons lang gekoesterde netwerk zullen wij nooit uit de weg gaan; die vormen namelijk de basis voor onze toegevoegde waarde.
Write a factual, complete and motivating text about the company. (E.g.: what does the company do, size, distinguishing characteristics)

B,Luiten,Production,"Luiten Food – Thomas Foods Europa is een warm familiebedrijf uit Stompwijk met een loyaal, ervaren en vooral betrokken team. Tot een aantal jaar geleden noemden wij ons importeur van vlees, wild en gevogelte. Dat dekt de lading echter al een tijdje niet meer: niet alleen hebben wij ons assortiment flink uitgebreid, maar ook is de import van onze producten inmiddels slechts het begin van een mooie schakel aan diensten die wij onze klanten bieden. Wij zijn uitgegroeid tot een essentiële partner voor onze supermarkt- en groothandelsklanten, omdat we producten ontwikkelen, portioneren, marineren, verpakken, etiketteren en volledig naar wens aanleveren. Alles gebeurt op basis van de specifieke klantwens, in samenwerking met onze partners. Ons assortiment wordt bepaald vanuit een duidelijke marktbehoefte: de proteïnen die wij importeren zijn in Europa nog niet verkrijgbaar, onvoldoende verkrijgbaar of in mindere kwaliteit verkrijgbaar.

Het importeren van kwaliteitsproducten blijft van primair belang voor ons. Zonder product kunnen wij namelijk het verschil niet maken voor onze klanten. Daarom hebben wij in 2018 besloten de samenwerking met de Australische rund- en lamsvleesproducent Thomas Foods International (TFI) te intensiveren, waarbij TFI een belang heeft genomen in Luiten Food – Thomas Foods Europa.  Als Thomas Foods Europa genieten wij nu al vijf jaar van productzekerheid en exclusiviteit voor deze twee productgroepen. Ons doel is meedoen op het hoogste niveau. Wij streven naar duurzame samenwerkingen met klanten en leveranciers: kwaliteit en betrouwbaarheid zullen op de lange termijn altijd zegevieren. Wie ons al langer kent, weet dat wij doen wat we beloven. Afspraak is afspraak. Wij realiseren bedrijfsgroei, omdat krimp simpelweg geen optie is. Alleen door continu te verbeteren, kunnen wij onze klanten de service bieden die zij van ons gewend zijn.

[COMPANY INFORMATION]
Company name: Luiten
Industry sector: Production
Company description: Luiten Food – Thomas Foods Europa is een warm familiebedrijf uit Stompwijk met een loyaal, ervaren en vooral betrokken team. Tot een aantal jaar geleden noemden wij ons importeur van vlees, wild en gevogelte. Dat dekt de lading echter al een tijdje niet meer: niet alleen hebben wij ons assortiment flink uitgebreid, maar ook is de import van onze producten inmiddels slechts het begin van een mooie schakel aan diensten die wij onze klanten bieden. Wij zijn uitgegroeid tot een essentiële partner voor onze supermarkt- en groothandelsklanten, omdat we producten ontwikkelen, portioneren, marineren, verpakken, etiketteren en volledig naar wens aanleveren. Alles gebeurt op basis van de specifieke klantwens, in samenwerking met onze partners. Ons assortiment wordt bepaald vanuit een duidelijke marktbehoefte: de proteïnen die wij importeren zijn in Europa nog niet verkrijgbaar, onvoldoende verkrijgbaar of in mindere kwaliteit verkrijgbaar.

Het importeren van kwaliteitsproducten blijft van primair belang voor ons. Zonder product kunnen wij namelijk het verschil niet maken voor onze klanten. Daarom hebben wij in 2018 besloten de samenwerking met de Australische rund- en lamsvleesproducent Thomas Foods International (TFI) te intensiveren, waarbij TFI een belang heeft genomen in Luiten Food – Thomas Foods Europa.  Als Thomas Foods Europa genieten wij nu al vijf jaar van productzekerheid en exclusiviteit voor deze twee productgroepen. Ons doel is meedoen op het hoogste niveau. Wij streven naar duurzame samenwerkingen met klanten en leveranciers: kwaliteit en betrouwbaarheid zullen op de lange termijn altijd zegevieren. Wie ons al langer kent, weet dat wij doen wat we beloven. Afspraak is afspraak. Wij realiseren bedrijfsgroei, omdat krimp simpelweg geen optie is. Alleen door continu te verbeteren, kunnen wij onze klanten de service bieden die zij van ons gewend zijn. Investeringen in het bedrijf, de machines, onze mensen en natuurlijk ons lang gekoesterde netwerk zullen wij nooit uit de weg gaan; die vormen namelijk de basis voor onze toegevoegde waarde.

B,Luiten,Production,"Luiten Food – Thomas Foods Europa is een warm familiebedrijf uit Stompwijk met een loyaal, ervaren en vooral betrokken team. Tot een aantal jaar geleden noemden wij ons importeur van vlees, wild en gevogelte. Dat dekt de lading echter al een tijdje niet meer: niet alleen hebben wij ons assortiment flink uitgebreid, maar ook is de import van onze producten inmiddels slechts het begin van een mooie schakel aan diensten die wij onze klanten bieden. Wij zijn uitgegroeid tot een essentiële partner voor onze supermarkt- en groothandelsklanten, omdat we producten ontwikkelen, portioneren, marineren, verpakken, etiketteren en volledig naar wens aanleveren. Alles gebeurt op basis van de specifieke klantwens, in samenwerking met onze partners. Ons assortiment wordt bepaald vanuit een duidelijke marktbehoefte: de proteïnen die wij importeren zijn in Europa nog niet verkrijgbaar, onvoldoende verkrijgbaar of in mindere kwaliteit verkrijgbaar.

Het importeren van kwaliteitsproducten blijft van primair belang voor ons. Zonder product kunnen wij namelijk het verschil niet maken voor onze klanten. Daarom hebben wij in 2018 besloten de samenwerking met de Australische rund- en lamsvleesproducent Thomas Foods International (TFI) te intensiveren, waarbij TFI een belang heeft genomen in Luiten Food – Thomas Foods Europa.  Als Thomas Foods Europa genieten wij nu al vijf jaar van productzekerheid en exclusiviteit voor deze twee productgroepen. Ons doel is meedoen op het hoogste niveau. Wij streven naar duurzame samenwerkingen met klanten en leveranciers: kwaliteit en betrouwbaarheid zullen op de lange termijn altijd zegevieren. Wie ons al langer kent, weet dat wij doen wat we beloven. Afspraak is afspraak. Wij realiseren bedrijfsgroei, omdat krimp simpelweg geen optie is. Alleen door continu te verbeteren, kunnen wij onze klanten de service bieden die zij van ons gewend zijn.

[COMPANY INFORMATION]
Company name: Luiten
Industry sector: Production
Company description: Luiten Food – Thomas Foods Europa is een warm familiebedrijf uit Stompwijk met een loyaal, ervaren en vooral betrokken team. Tot een aantal jaar geleden noemden wij ons importeur van vlees, wild en gevogelte. Dat dekt de lading echter al een tijdje niet meer: niet alleen hebben wij ons assortiment flink uitgebreid, maar ook is de import van onze producten inmiddels slechts het begin van een mooie schakel aan diensten die wij onze klanten bieden. Wij zijn uitgegroeid tot een essentiële partner voor onze supermarkt- en groothandelsklanten, omdat we producten ontwikkelen, portioneren, marineren, verpakken, etiketteren en volledig naar wens aanleveren. Alles gebeurt op basis van de specifieke klantwens, in samenwerking met onze partners. Ons assortiment wordt bepaald vanuit een duidelijke marktbehoefte: de proteïnen die wij importeren zijn in Europa nog niet verkrijgbaar, onvoldoende verkrijgbaar of in mindere kwaliteit verkrijgbaar.

Het importeren van kwaliteitsproducten blijft van primair belang voor ons. Zonder product kunnen wij namelijk het verschil niet maken voor onze klanten. Daarom hebben wij in 2018 besloten de samenwerking met de Australische rund- en lamsvleesproducent Thomas Foods International (TFI) te intensiveren, waarbij TFI een belang heeft genomen in Luiten Food – Thomas Foods Europa.  Als Thomas Foods Europa genieten wij nu al vijf jaar van productzekerheid en exclusiviteit voor deze twee productgroepen. Ons doel is meedoen op het hoogste niveau. Wij streven naar duurzame samenwerkingen met klanten en leveranciers: kwaliteit en betrouwbaarheid zullen op de lange termijn altijd zegevieren. Wie ons al langer kent, weet dat wij doen wat we beloven. Afspraak is afspraak. Wij realiseren bedrijfsgroei, omdat krimp simpelweg geen optie is. Alleen door continu te verbeteren, kunnen wij onze klanten de service bieden die zij van ons gewend zijn. Investeringen in het bedrijf, de machines, onze mensen en natuurlijk ons lang gekoesterde netwerk zullen wij nooit uit de weg gaan; die vormen namelijk de basis voor onze toegevoegde waarde.
Write a factual, complete and motivating text about the company. (E.g.: what does the company do, size, distinguishing characteristics)
