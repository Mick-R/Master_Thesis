    "\n",
    "## Key Components\n",
    "1. **Evaluation Metrics**\n",
    "- Implements metrics derived from expert interviews and literature\n",
    "- Provides quantitative scoring across multiple quality dimensions with multiple techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Analysis Reporting**\n",
    "- Tracks efficiency through step counting\n",
    "- Documents pipeline performance across evaluation iterations\n",
    "- Generates detailed breakdowns of metric-specific assessments\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Experiments**\n",
    "- Experimenting with the performance of each metric\n",
    "- Modifying the metrics until high agreement with human evaluations\n",
    "- Revising prompts to generate consistent job listings\n"
