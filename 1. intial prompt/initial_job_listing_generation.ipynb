    "### Language-Specific Implementation\n",

    "**Template Structure:**\n",
    "- System role definition (recruitment specialist)\n",
    "- Job details (title, location, employment type, hours, education, experience, salary)\n",
    "- Responsibilities and employment conditions\n",
    "- Writing guidelines (tone, jargon level, word count)\n",
    "- Content rules (gender neutrality, cliché avoidance)\n",
    "- Candidate profile integration\n",
    "- Company information requirements\n",
    "- Output format specification\n",
    "\n",
    "### Few-Shot Learning Integration\n",
    "**Company-specific examples:** 10 verified job listings per recruitment company loaded from Excel files:\n",
    "- Companies A, C, D (Dutch): `combined_rest_dutch`\n",
    "- Companies B, E (English): `combined_rest_english`\n",
